                        Besides my Bachelor of Science studies at the Bern University of Applied Sciences, I am also working at the private hospital "Lindenhofgruppe AG". 
                        I work in different projects of the computer science or from the business. <br/>
                        This includes the creation of specifications and coordination of cooperation with external suppliers and internal customers. <br/>
                        But what I find most interesting is being involved in the introduction and further development of hospital applications. <br/></p>

                        I went alone for several months to Hawaii and Australia to
                        improve my English skills. Of course, the main focus was not 
                        only on learning, but discovering the world. I was on the road 
                        a lot and made a lot of new friends in between. You can see more below.</p>

                        In Switzerland, military service is compulsory. I wanted to do something other than just sit in front of the computer. 
                        That's why I decided to do my military service as a military police officer. 
                        I went through the whole recruit school and then through the longtime-service (Durchdiener). 
                        It was an interesting time to work with the professional military. </p>

                        After my apprenticeship, I stayed with my company for a few months to gain more experience. 
                        There I specialized with the creation of Powershell in complex environments. Performing migrations was a big part of my projects. 
                        Beside the scripts, the customer consulting in system technical matters was in the foreground (2nd level support and 1st level support). 
                        In addition, the fulfillment of all duties resulting from the valid security directives in the federal administration for the tasks 
                        described above was of the highest priority.</p>

                        I successfully completed my apprenticeship as an EFZ computer scientist at the Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telematics (BIT) with 
                        the in-service technical vocational baccalaureate. 
                        This provided me with a versatile, exciting and professional education. I was able to acquire in-depth IT expertise. 
                        I was mainly concerned with automation to support work processes using PowerShell scripts. I also participated in various projects and managed some of them.  
                        In addition to my more than four years of professional experience in the IT world, my strengths include a quick grasp, flexibility, ability to work in a team 
                        and a willingness to learn new things. I think in a networked way, am analytical and like to take responsibility. Based on this, I would fit into your team.</p>
